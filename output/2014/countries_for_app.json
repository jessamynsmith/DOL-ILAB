    "Description": "In 2014, Afghanistan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Afghanistan announced the adoption of a list of 29 occupations and working conditions prohibited for children. The Government also took steps to combat child trafficking by acceding to the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and issuing a directive to improve enforcement of the current law on human trafficking. In addition, the Government passed a law criminalizing the recruitment of children under age 18 into state security institutions and the Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee on Children and Armed Conflict approved a new roadmap to support efforts to end underage recruitment. However, children in Afghanistan are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced production of bricks. Children also continued to be recruited and used for military purposes by non-state groups, and were in limited instances used by some members of state groups to carry out specific tasks. Afghanistan’s labor inspectorate does not have legal authority to enforce child labor laws, and the Government lacks programs to eliminate child labor in certain sectors in which it is prevalent.",

The Government also signed the Inter-Agency Child Protection Protocol to facilitate interagency collaboration on child protection issues. However, although the problem does not appear to be widespread, children in Anguilla are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, specifically in commercial sexual exploitation. The law in Anguilla does not appear to prohibit children ages 14 to 18 from engaging in dangerous work or provide a comprehensive list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children. The Government also lacks a developed framework and targeted programs that address the commercial sexual exploitation of children.",

The Government’s Provincial Commissions for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor (COPRETI) provided key trainings to labor inspectors on child labor issues, and the Executive Council to Fight Human Trafficking provided additional training to officials on human trafficking issues. The National Registry of Agricultural Workers and Employers (RENATEA) also launched a program to lengthen the school day and create child care centers for children of agricultural laborers to reduce their vulnerability to child labor. However, children in Argentina are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Argentina has not adopted a list of hazardous occupations that are prohibited for children, and the country appears to lack programs that target working children in several key sectors.",

Armenia has received an assessment of minimal advancement because the Government lacks a labor inspectorate to monitor, inspect, and enforce child labor laws. This gap in enforcement delays the advancements made in eliminating child labor during the reporting period. In addition, the Government lacks a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address all forms of child labor, including its worst forms, and no programs exist to aid children engaged in work activities on the street or in agriculture. Children in Armenia continue to engage in child labor in the services sector. Despite these gaps, the Government did make efforts to prevent and eliminate child labor, including enacting legislation to improve the identification of and provision of services to victims of human trafficking.",

In addition, the Government funded a program for the rehabilitation of child victims of human trafficking. However, children in Azerbaijan are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation.

The Government provided training on child labor issues to law enforcement agencies, and developed a new program to train officials on its trafficking in persons and commercial sexual exploitation legislation, passed in 2013. However, children in Belize are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Important gaps in the country’s legal framework remain. Belize does not set a minimum age of 14 for work for all sectors, and the country lacks a list of hazardous occupations that are prohibited for children. In addition, the Government does not appear to have programs that aim to reduce child labor in agriculture, a sector in which it remains prevalent.",

The Government adopted the National Policy for Child Protection and the Action Plan to Eradicate Child Exploitation in major national markets. The Government also increased the capacity of the Office for the Protection of Minors by extending its child protection services to 12 geographical departments of Benin where they did not previously exist. The Government continued to operate social advancement centers that provide social and reintegration services to children withdrawn from child trafficking and labor. However, children in Benin are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and particularly in the production of cotton, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. The national action plan pertaining to the worst forms of child labor remains unfunded and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.",

However, children in Bhutan engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work. Bhutan’s minimum age for work is inconsistent with international standards and education is not compulsory. Law enforcement agencies did not provide any data on actions to combat child labor, including its worst forms.",

    "Description": "In 2014, Bolivia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor increased its number of labor inspectors from 78 to 95, and dedicated 9 of these inspectors to investigating child labor in high-risk areas. The Government also published a national policy to combat human trafficking that aims to implement the Comprehensive Law against Human Trafficking and Smuggling. However, children in Bolivia are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in mining. Bolivia has received an assessment of minimal advancement because in July 2014, the Government passed a new Child and Adolescent Code that allows children as young as 10 years old to be self-employed under certain conditions. This action undermined the advancements made in eliminating child labor. In addition, the Offices of the Child Advocate, required by the new Code to authorize child work and assist victims of child labor, are absent or underfunded in many municipalities, leaving some children unprotected and vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. The Government also lacks a comprehensive child labor policy.",

The Government created mobile inspection units to coordinate child labor law enforcement efforts between regional Ministry of Labor and other local inspectors. Law 12.978 was signed; it specifies penalties in the Penal Code for the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Inspectors carried out inspections targeting child labor in 165 commercial establishments in the state of Bahia during Brazil’s Carnival season in February, and in many tourist sites during the World Cup in June. The National Education Plan was also signed, and an additional 9 million schools participated in the More Education (Mais Educação) program. However, children are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Some local governments lack adequate resources to fully implement national programs to combat child labor, including programs to combat child trafficking.",

The Government published a study on hazardous child labor in order to update existing legislation and established the National Coordination Committee for the National Action Plan on the Fight against the Worst Forms of Child Labor. The Government also adopted Law N° 011-2014/AN Suppressing the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, which strengthens existing prohibitions on commercial sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. However, children in Burkina Faso are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor and the lack of funding has hampered the implementation of child labor policies. Despite an uprising in October that ousted longtime President Blaise Compaoré, the Government continued to address child labor issues.",

The government also successfully prosecuted offenders for trafficking girls into domestic service. However, children in Burundi are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Education in Burundi is not compulsory, increasing the risk of children’s involvement in child labor. In addition, the Government did not conduct any child labor inspections during the reporting period.",

The Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MOLVT) created 24 interdepartmental inspection teams, which include a child labor inspector, and significantly increased the number of inspections and the number of inspectors trained to conduct child labor investigations. Additionally, the Government made several efforts to combat trafficking in persons (TIP), including drafting guidelines for the identification and referral of victims of TIP and sexual exploitation, and implementing them in six target areas. However, children in Cambodia continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor as victims of human trafficking. The legal framework leaves children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor as there is no compulsory education requirement, and the law allows children as young as age 12 to engage in domestic work. Labor inspectors lack sufficient resources to adequately monitor child labor.",

However, children in CAR are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict, sometimes as a result of forced or compulsory recruitment by armed groups. Widespread violence and continued instability limited the Government’s ability to address the worst forms of child labor and armed groups on all sides of the conflict increased their use of child soldiers.

Additionally, the UN Secretary General removed Chad from its list of governments that recruit and use child soldiers. However, children in Chad are engaged in child labor, including in cattle herding and agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation.

The Government created the Social Observatory to Eradicate Child Labor, a coordinating mechanism for research and outreach efforts on child and adolescent labor. As part of the ongoing implementation of Education Decree 280 of 2009, indigenous language and cultural education is now required at schools with 20 percent or more indigenous children. The National Minors’ Service (SENAME) assisted 1,290 child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. SENAME registered 386 cases in its Worst Forms of Child Labor Registry. Chile also continued to implement several programs targeting the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Chile are engaged in child labor, including in retail, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in illicit activities. The Government has yet to adopt a new national plan against child labor.",

The Government passed Law 1719, which guarantees access to legal services for victims of commercial sexual exploitation and armed conflict; implemented Child Labor Pacts to assist in the formulation of child labor policies and laws and improve coordination between the Ministry of Labor and other government agencies; and launched the Network Against Child Labor campaign to unite 14 businesses in efforts to eliminate child labor in their supply chains. The Government also continued to participate in a project to combat child labor and improve workplace health and safety in mining. However, children in Colombia are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and street work, and in the worst forms of child labor as they continue to be forcibly recruited by illegal non-state armed groups. Limited interagency coordination and inadequate resources hinder Government efforts to combat child labor.",

The Government also increased the coverage of the Police Morals and Minors Brigade by establishing new brigades on the islands of Anjouan and Moheli, where the majority of human trafficking cases reportedly occur. However, children in Comoros are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work. A gap between the minimum age for work and the age for compulsory education leaves children ages 13 to 15 vulnerable to child labor. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor are also insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.",

However, children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continue to engage in child labor, including in domestic work, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in the forced mining of gold, cassiterite (tin ore), coltan (tantalum ore), and wolframite (tungsten ore). The Government failed to prosecute or convict any individual of child labor violations, and the prescribed penalties for forced or compulsory labor remain low and do not serve as a deterrent. There are few social programs to assist child laborers, and laws and regulations mandating free primary education are not enforced.",

The Government conducted a labor survey which included a subsurvey to determine the activities of working children; issued a decree to implement the Trafficking and Worst Forms of Child Labor Law that was adopted in 2010; and adopted a National Policy Document on Child Protection. The Government also established a National Committee for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons; increased the budget of the Directorate for the Fight Against Child Labor by $800,000; continued to support social programs that address child labor in support of activities under the National Action Plan against Trafficking, Exploitation, and Child Labor (NAP); and completed the pilot phase of the child labor monitoring system known as Système d’Observation et de Suivi du Travail des Enfants en Côte d’Ivoire (SOSTECI). However, children in Côte d’Ivoire are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in domestic work and agriculture, particularly on cocoa farms, sometimes under conditions of forced labor. Gaps remain in enforcement efforts and in children’s access to education.",

Despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Dominican Republic is receiving this assessment because certain children remain at increased vulnerability to labor exploitation due to limitations on educational opportunities related to the interpretation and implementation of Dominican law and policies on the right to education.",

The Ministry of Tourism and DINAPEN signed an agreement to coordinate the prevention of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Ecuador also continued to participate in a number of programs targeting the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Ecuador continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Ecuador still faces resource constraints that prevent labor inspectors from conducting inspections and enforcing child labor laws.",

The Government also participated in a program designed to improve school attendance. However, children in Egypt are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and domestic work.

The Government signed the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, a development initiative that includes among its many goals increasing educational and vocational training opportunities for youth and combatting human trafficking. The Government passed the Special Law Against Trafficking in Persons that increased penalties for the trafficking of children to a minimum of 16 years in prison, and permanently established the Attorney General’s anti-trafficking unit and the National Council Against Trafficking in Persons (CNCTP). The Government’s National Council for Children and Adolescents (CONNA) provided technical assistance in developing Departmental and Local Committees for Children’s and Adolescents’ Rights, pursuant to the Law for the Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents (LEPINA). The Government also expanded educational programs that aim to keep children in schools and out of harmful activities by providing meals, supplies, and extracurricular activities. However, children in El Salvador are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in illicit activities sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Law enforcement agencies continue to lack sufficient resources to enforce child labor laws, and monetary penalties for labor violations remain low.",

In addition, although Eritrean law prohibits the recruitment of children under age 18 into the armed forces, there may be children enrolled in the Government’s compulsory military training program. Gaps in the legal framework exist, including a lack of specific penalties for employers of children in hazardous work and employers of children under the minimum age for work.",

The Government also approved the Free Education Grant policy that provides 13 years of free, basic education to children in Fiji and implemented a transportation assistance program that will improve access to schools for children in the most remote areas of the country. However, children in Fiji are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and street work.

Children in Georgia continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in forced begging.

The Government also released the results of its Living Standards Survey Round 6, which included a subsection dedicated to child labor. However, children in Ghana continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in agriculture, including in cocoa and fishing. Enforcement of legal protections against the worst forms of child labor is severely limited due to resource constraints, and social programs do not cover all of the sectors in which children work.",

    "Description": "In 2014, Guatemala made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government signed the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, a development initiative that includes among its many goals increasing educational and vocational training opportunities for youth and combatting human trafficking. The Government also implemented the Public Policy on Human Trafficking and Comprehensive Protection of Victims (2014–2024), establishing government-run shelters for victims of human trafficking. The Secretariat Against Sexual Violence, Exploitation, and Trafficking in Persons’ (SVET) budget reached $2 million, the highest in its history. Also, for the first time in Guatemala, six individuals were prosecuted by the Public Ministry and convicted of trafficking for labor purposes. However, children in Guatemala are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The lack of government resources, inability of the labor inspectorate to impose fines, and inadequate judicial enforcement of court orders remain key challenges for enforcement efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor. The Government delayed payments to recipients from the conditional cash transfer program, Mi Bono Seguro, and there is a lack of social programs targeting sectors in which children are known to engage in exploitative labor, such as domestic work and agriculture, as well as other sectors.",

The Government also extended the National Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons for an additional year and funded a center to protect victims of child trafficking. However, children in Guinea are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining. The Government lacks a coordinating mechanism and national policy to address all relevant worst forms of child labor. In addition, there are limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws and social programs to combat child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem. During the last half of 2014, the Government had to redirect most of its resources to address an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Hundreds of children became ill or lost parents during the outbreak and schools were closed from June through December.",

The Ministerial Task Force on Trafficking in Persons released a 2014–2015 Action Plan and held a series of talks to educate communities on human trafficking. The Government continues to provide free uniforms and school meals to encourage school attendance. However, children in Guyana continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Guyana’s legislation does not fully protect children from the worst forms of child labor, and the labor inspectorate lacks sufficient funding and capacity to carry out inspections.

    "Description": "In 2014, Haiti made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government adopted the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law, which criminalizes all forms of human trafficking and contains provisions to prevent child trafficking and other worst forms of child labor. The law also creates a National Committee for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons that provides legal protection and social assistance to victims of human trafficking. The Government also created the Child Protection Working Group to coordinate efforts on child protection, specifically for children in domestic work. Moreover, Haiti ratified UN CRC Optional Protocols on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and Children in Armed Conflict. However, children in Haiti are engaged in child labor, including in domestic work and agriculture. Haiti lacks a clear, easily applicable minimum age for domestic work. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Social programs to combat child labor are also insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.",

The Government also created a Prosecutorial Task Force to investigate and prosecute human trafficking and the smuggling of unaccompanied migrant youth. In addition, the Government created the Directorate of Childhood, Adolescence, and Family (DINAF) to better monitor children’s rights and implement national plans concerning children and their families. However, children in Honduras are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation as a result of human trafficking. The Government’s procedures for enforcement of child labor laws do not sufficiently deter employers from using child labor, and both labor inspectors and criminal investigators lack the resources they need to effectively carry out their mandates.",

The Government implemented its National Child Labor Project to assist child laborers through the provision of loans and alternative livelihoods, and several social protection programs to address the root causes of child labor. The Ministry of Home Affairs also launched an online human trafficking portal to coordinate efforts of state and national government agencies. However, children in India are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and manufacturing. Basic legal protections for children remain weak. Legislation to prohibit work by all children under the age of 14 and to proscribe hazardous work for children under age 18 was approved by the Prime Minister’s Cabinet in 2012, but it has yet to be passed by Parliament.",

The Ministry of Labor completed the third and final phase of the National Action Plan (NAP) for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor (2002–2022) by adopting the Roadmap for the Acceleration of Making Indonesia Free of Child Labor by 2022. Local governments issued regulations to harmonize local legislation with national legislation to reinforce the legal and regulatory framework regarding the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the Government allocated significant increases in funding to the Unconditional Cash Transfer program, which works to increase livelihoods of the poorest families, and the Block Grants for Schools program, which compensates schools for the loss of income incurred when waiving fees, thereby ensuring free education for poor and vulnerable children. However, children in Indonesia continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic service. The Government has yet to adopt the Domestic Worker’s Protection Bill which would be a stronger source of protections for child domestic workers. In addition, enforcement of child labor laws remains a challenge due to a lack of labor inspectors and sufficient resources to carry out effective inspections, and the Government lacks comprehensive, publically available data on child labor and trafficking investigations, violations, and convictions.",

Jamaica also expanded the Program for Advancement through Health and Education, a conditional cash transfer program, to reach more vulnerable families. In addition, the Government updated the curriculum for new police recruits by including an anti-trafficking training module. However, children in Jamaica are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Although the Government has laws prohibiting the use of children in some illicit activities, it does not prohibit the use of children for drug trafficking and production.

Kazakhstan has received an assessment of minimal advancement because its President issued a decree in February 2014 placing a moratorium on inspections of small and medium-size businesses, resulting in the Government not enforcing its child labor laws. This gap in enforcement delays the advancements made in eliminating child labor during the reporting period. In addition, there is limited comprehensive and current research on child labor and programs to combat the worst forms of child labor are insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem. Children in Kazakhstan are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in cotton farming. Despite these gaps, the Government did make efforts to prevent and eliminate child labor, including making children engaged in the worst forms of child labor eligible for social protection services and developing a new national action plan on human trafficking.",

In addition, the Government issued two decisions determining the roles and responsibilities of educational institutions and agriculture sector employees in preventing and eliminating child labor. However, children in Kosovo are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Children from minority communities continue to face barriers to accessing education. In addition, both the Labor Inspectorate and the Kosovo Police’s Directorate of Trafficking in Human Being Investigation face gaps in the availability of resources and the collection and publishing of data on enforcement efforts.",

During the last half of 2014, the Government had to redirect most of its resources to address an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Thousands of children became ill or lost parents during the outbreak and schools were closed from June through the end of the reporting period in December. Despite the EVD outbreak, the Government sponsored trafficking in persons trainings for law enforcement officers and community leaders. The Child Protection Network developed a 6-month strategic plan to respond to vulnerable group of children in post-Ebola Liberia. However, children in Liberia are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and mining. The Government has yet to pass into law the Decent Work Bill, which prohibits hazardous occupations and activities for children, and child labor law enforcement efforts are still inadequate.",

    "Description": "In 2014, Maldives made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Family and Child Protection Unit established four new “safe homes” to provide short-term protection for women and children. Anti-trafficking units, consisting of 10 officers dedicated to investigating human trafficking, were created in the Maldives Police Service (MPS) and the Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE). The Government also continued to fund and participate in programs to improve access to education. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children in Maldives are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Government has not determined specific hazardous occupations or activities that are prohibited for children and the compulsory education age of 13 leaves children ages 13 to 15 vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.",

The Government adopted the National Policy for Child Promotion and Protection, which aims to strengthen national policies and programs to protect children from violence, human trafficking, and exploitative work. The Government also participated in several programs to combat the worst forms of child labor and assist vulnerable households. In northern Mali, the Government made progress in providing access to education by returning 83 percent of children to school and reopening 74 percent of schools for the 2013/2014 academic year. However, children in Mali are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in gold mining. Children were also abducted and forcibly recruited by armed rebel and extremist Islamic militia groups and some of these children were detained and charged with crimes for their association with these groups. Laws relating to the worst forms of child labor do not provide adequate coverage and gaps in enforcement have left children unprotected.",

The Government updated its list of hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children and raised the compulsory education age to 18. The Government also took action to improve its policy framework by passing the sixth consecutive National Plan for Preventing and Combatting Human Trafficking, which develops a guide for improving prevention efforts, referral mechanisms, and support services for child victims of human trafficking. The Government also launched a new hotline to provide information and register complaints for children experiencing violence, neglect or exploitation, including exploitation through child labor. However, children in Moldova are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Funding for the State Labor Inspectorate (SLI) was not sufficient and the Inspectorate’s efforts to enforce child labor laws were hindered by barriers to conducting unannounced inspections. While the Government provides some financial support to programs addressing child labor, including human trafficking, most major child labor programs have been donor funded. These programs do not appear to be sustainable without outside financial assistance.",

The Government established a Child Hotline to receive reports of child abuse and refer cases to the police, including reports related to exploitative child labor. In addition, law enforcement agencies improved efforts to monitor horse races for compliance with age and safety requirements for child horse jockeys. The Government’s Crime Prevention and Awareness Fund provided approximately $30,000 for Anti-Trafficking activities in 2014, including training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors on investigation and victim identification techniques. However, children in Mongolia are engaged in child labor, including in animal husbandry and herding and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Gaps persist in the legal framework and operating procedures for prosecuting criminal offenders, specifically regarding commercial sexual exploitation. The Government also lacks social programs to address child labor in certain relevant sectors.",

It also is unclear whether the law prohibits the use of children in illicit activities such as drug trafficking, begging, and theft or burglary. These gaps in legislation leave children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.",

The Government continues to delay approving legislation that would protect children employed in domestic work and the number of labor inspectors is insufficient to effectively enforce child labor laws.",

In December, the Child Care and Protection Bill was passed by the National Assembly and reviewed by the National Council; the bill is awaiting signature by the President and placement in the gazette. However, children in Namibia are engaged in child labor, including in herding livestock, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation.

In addition, the Ministry of Education began a pilot project for compulsory basic education, and several local governments funded activities and awareness-raising campaigns against child labor. However, children in Nepal are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Nepal lacks a compulsory education law, and children ages 16 and 17 are excluded from the protections of the country’s hazardous work list, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. The number of investigations and convictions for child trafficking is also inadequate given the scope of trafficking in Nepal.",

The Government also trained 6,082 officials on child labor issues, and the Ministry of Labor increased its number of labor inspectors from 90 to 97. With support from the World Food Program, the Government continued to expand its school meal program, which now reaches over one million children. However, children in Nicaragua are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. National policies to eliminate child labor and protect children have not been fully implemented, and the Government appears to lack a specific and consistent mechanism to coordinate efforts to address child labor. In addition, the Government has not published national statistics on child labor since 2005.",

The Government adopted the National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons which will provide protection and social assistance to victims of human trafficking, including children. Law enforcement officials received training on child labor and human trafficking, as well as rescued and assisted 45 children from Koranic teachers that exploited them as street beggars. Further, the Government participated in a new program to combat forced labor. However, children in Niger are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining. Laws relating to the worst forms of child labor do not provide adequate coverage and gaps in enforcement have left children unprotected. Social programs to combat child labor are also insufficient to adequately address the extent of the problem.",

However, children in Pakistan engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including bonded labor. Provincial Governments have not established a minimum working age, and the federal minimum age for hazardous work falls short of international standards. Not all of Pakistan’s provinces prohibit human trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, and the use of children in illicit activities.

    "Description": "In 2014, Papua New Guinea made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government enacted the Criminal Code Amendment Act, which prohibits all forms of human trafficking and establishes penalties for trafficking children. To complement this new legislation, the Department of Justice and the Attorney General (DJAG) worked with the IOM to draft Papua New Guinea’s first Trafficking in Persons National Action Plan (TiPNAP). The Government also launched an anti-trafficking training program in Port Moresby and seven border provinces to familiarize police officers and other relevant actors with the contents of the new anti-trafficking law and to facilitate its effective enforcement. However, children in Papua New Guinea are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work and commercial sexual exploitation, each sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Papua New Guinea does not have legislation to comprehensively prohibit hazardous occupations and activities for children. Additionally, child labor laws are not effectively enforced and the lack of compulsory education may increase the risk of children’s involvement in the worst forms of child labor. The Government lacks social programs to specifically assist children engaged in child labor in all relevant sectors.",

The Government strengthened legal protections for incarcerated adolescents by specifying the circumstances and conditions under which they can work in the Penal Implementation Code, included funds in its 2015 budget to hire 40 additional labor inspectors, and established working groups to strengthen coordination among government agencies on child labor issues. In addition, the Government continued to fund conditional cash transfer programs to combat child labor. However, children in Paraguay are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work. Coordination mechanisms among government agencies working to eradicate child labor need strengthening and remain underfunded relative to the scope of the problem. In addition, the Government is unable to provide accurate statistics on whether businesses were fined for child labor infractions because labor inspectors report the fines in aggregate.",

The Public Ministry opened a criminal prosecution office in Lima to specialize in human trafficking cases, and the National Labor Inspection Superintendency hired over 90 new labor inspectors and opened 8 regional offices. However, children in Peru continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Peruvian law does not fully comply with international standards to protect children engaged in night work and hazardous work. Labor inspectorates remain underfunded and the number of child labor inspections is insufficient, especially in regions with the highest rates of child labor. In addition, not all Regional Commissions for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor have drafted and funded action plans to combat child labor, although they are mandated to do so.",

    "Description": "In 2014, the Philippines made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) finalized its Strategic Plan for 2014–2016, which will serve as the operational framework to address components of the Philippine Program Against Child Labor (PPACL). Four NCLC subcommittees conducted year-end assessments on the accomplishments of their respective 2014 strategic plans to identify the implementation gaps and formulate their 2015 strategic plans under the PPACL Strategic Framework. The Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) trained over 5,000 service providers to ensure the protection, prevention, and prosecution of human trafficking cases, and established three additional regional task forces bringing the countrywide total to 19. However, children in the Philippines are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and domestic work. Despite nearly doubling the number of Labor Law Compliance Officers (LLCO), enforcement of child labor laws remains challenging due to the limited number of inspectors and lack of resources for inspections.",

The Government continued the implementation of a social protection mechanism defined by the Social Contract law to financially support vulnerable citizens, including child trafficking victims. The Government also continued support of the Russian Children in Need Fund, which aims to rehabilitate disadvantaged and homeless children. However, children in Russia are engaged in child labor, including in work on the street, and in the worst forms of child labor, including being used in the production of pornography. Laws do not prohibit possession of child pornography or benefiting from its proceeds. In addition, Russia continues to lack a mechanism to coordinate nationwide efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor, and it has no social programs specifically targeting this goal.",

The Government of Rwanda secured funding to continue the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission Child Rehabilitation Program, provided funding for districts to implement child protection programs, created District Steering Committees on Child Labor in all 30 districts, and adopted a national anti-trafficking plan of action. The Government also participates in and implements several additional programs to combat the worst forms of child labor, including child trafficking. However, children in Rwanda are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic service. Gaps exist in the Government’s enforcement of laws on child labor, and social programs lack adequate safeguards to protect children engaged in domestic service.",

The Government passed the Occupational Safety and Health Regulations Act that improves the legal framework for identification, assessment, and control of hazards in the workplace. Government ministries also participated in the National Forum on Child Labor, formulating a task force to review legislation related to the enforcement of international child labor conventions. However, children in Samoa are engaged in child labor, including in street vending. The Government lacks legislation that specifically and comprehensively describes the hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children. The law does not define or specify a minimum age for light work. In addition, there was no publicly available information to confirm that criminal law enforcement agencies made efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor, and the Government did not implement any programs to address child labor in the sectors in which it is prevalent.",

The Government also established 92 child protection teams across the country that provided social services to street children, and 10 new anti-trafficking teams to improve prevention and protection efforts at the local level. However, children in Serbia are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging, sometimes as a result of human trafficking, and in commercial sexual exploitation as a result of human trafficking. Serbia does not have legislation that clearly and comprehensively describes the hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children. The Government also lacks a national policy to combat child labor and a mechanism to effectively coordinate efforts to address child labor across government agencies.",

The Government enacted the Immigration Act, which prohibits transnational human trafficking and establishes specific penalties for the trafficking of children. Multiagency inspection teams also made site visits to logging camps and fishing areas throughout the country to inspect for human trafficking violations. With technical assistance from the ILO, the Government participated in a Child Labor and Trafficking Forum and a rapid assessment workshop to identify and develop strategies to address the worst forms of child labor in the country. However, children in Solomon Islands are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Education is not compulsory, and laws do not adequately protect all children from hazardous work and commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the Government has not established a body to coordinate efforts to combat child labor, and resources for enforcement are lacking.",

However, children in Somalia are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict. The terrorist organization al-Shabaab remained the main perpetrator of the abduction and use of child soldiers in Somalia. The Somalia National Army also continued to use child soldiers. There are reports that the Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama’a militia, which has not yet integrated into the Somalia National Security Forces, also used child soldiers. Somalia continued to lack many necessary mechanisms to effectively address the worst forms of child labor, including established labor and criminal law enforcement systems.",

    "Description": "In 2014, South Africa made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government passed amendments to the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, which extended protection to children working in the informal sector and increased the penalty for child labor violations from 3 to 6 years imprisonment. The Government also drafted regulations to implement the 2013 Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act. The Government’s Department of Home Affairs published new regulations for the 2002 Immigration Act that includes new documentation requirements intended to prevent the illegal movement of children. The Government’s Department of Social Development also implemented a food relief program for households with vulnerable and orphaned children, as well as child-headed households. Studies also indicate that the Government's Child Support Grant and the Old Age Pension may help reduce child labor. However, children in South Africa are engaged in child labor, including agriculture and domestic work. Government social programs to address child labor do not match the scope of the problem and barriers to education access remain. The Government also does not make enforcement data publicly available.",

    "Description": "In 2014, Thailand made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Despite political unrest during the year and a military coup in May 2014, the Government took actions to address child labor. Thailand made changes to its legal framework to raise the minimum age for agricultural work from 13 to 15 years, and for work on sea fishing vessels from 16 to 18 years. It also created a national policy committee, including several subcommittees and task forces, to improve policy formulation, interagency coordination, and implementation regarding migrant workers and human trafficking problems. In addition, the Government funded and participated in multiple programs that include the goal of eliminating or preventing child labor, including its worst forms. However, children in Thailand continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the shrimp and seafood processing sector, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Thailand remains weak in its enforcement efforts, particularly in the fishing, agriculture, manufacturing, and home-based business sectors, as well as in the informal sector. The Government also lacks nationwide data on child labor, which impedes the effectiveness of policies and programs.",

In addition, the General Labor Inspectorate Directorate created a new department to deal specifically with child labor issues and hired two additional inspectors. Government officials responsible for the enforcement of child labor laws, including labor inspectors and police officers, participated in numerous trainings on child labor investigation and victim identification procedures. However, children in Timor-Leste are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture. Although the NCCL/CNTI approved a list of hazardous occupations and activities prohibited for children, the list has not yet been legally adopted, leaving children vulnerable to engagement in hazardous work.",

The Government of Togo launched a microfinance project that granted loans to 324,000 individuals and implemented a conditional cash transfer project benefitting 214 villages. In addition, 265 primary schools were constructed as part of a World Bank-funded project. However, children in Togo are engaged in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Government has not devoted sufficient resources to effectively enforce its child labor laws. Togo’s social programs to combat the worst forms of child labor do not match the scope of the problem, and rely largely on NGOs and international organizations for implementation.",

The Government signed the Declaration of the Regional Initiative: Latin America and the Caribbean Free of Child Labor, which includes Trinidad and Tobago’s participation in the regional coordination of child labor elimination strategies. The Government also participated in a regional dialogue on child labor in the First Meeting of the Working Groups of the XVIII Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor. Labor inspectors and rural labor advocates participated in specialized workshops on child trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children. Although the problem does not appear to be widespread, children are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The Children’s Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, which is mandated to protect children’s rights by the Children’s Authority Act of 2000 and the Children’s Authority (Amendment) Act of 2008, is still not fully operational. The Government also has yet to ratify a list of hazardous occupations prohibited for children.",

The Directorate General for Migration Management, a new coordinating body for the implementation of migration law, including laws related to child trafficking and refugee children, began functioning during the reporting period. In addition, together with the EU, the Government funded a project that included the goal of combating child labor by helping parents of working children to find employment. The Government also trained labor inspectors and law enforcement personnel on issues related to child trafficking and hazardous child labor. However, children in Turkey are engaged in child labor in agriculture, including in mobile seasonal work, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government does not have laws that protect children working in agricultural enterprises employing fewer than 50 workers, in small shops employing up to three persons, or in domestic work. In addition, children in the growing Syrian refugee population in Turkey have low access to education and other social services, which leaves them at increased risk of exploitation in the worst forms of child labor.",

In addition, the Government has not collected data to determine the prevalence and nature of the worst forms of child labor in the country to inform policy and program development.",

During the year, Ukraine experienced the election of a new government, armed conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the south and east of the country, and the illegal attempted annexation of Crimea by Russia, which may impact the Government’s ability to address the worst forms of child labor. The Government partnered with the IOM, the OSCE, and the anti-trafficking NGO La Strada to carry out several awareness-raising campaigns to combat human trafficking. These campaigns were targeted at youth displaced by the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the occupation of Crimea, who are at increased risk of becoming human trafficking victims. The Government also published a report on the efforts made in 2013 to implement the National Program for Combating Human Trafficking Until 2015. However, children in Ukraine are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in pornography. There are no laws or regulations that prohibit possessing child pornography or benefitting from its proceeds, and the age of consent for sexual relationships is not clearly defined. The National Action Plan for Child Protection and the National Program for Combating Human Trafficking remained underfunded in 2014. Furthermore, shelter and rehabilitation centers for children, including street children and victims of human trafficking, are insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem.",

The Government expanded the National Action Plan to End Child Labor in Garbage Scavenging to include a study of adolescent work in agriculture in rural areas and established the Office of Rural Employment within the Ministry of Labor to work directly with rural communities. The Ministry of Labor hired 20 additional labor inspectors and the Ministry of Interior held a series of workshops to train police, immigration officials, prosecutors, and judges on human trafficking issues. However, children in Uruguay continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in garbage scavenging and commercial sexual exploitation. The Government does not collect or publish information on the number of investigations, prosecutions, and convictions for labor and criminal law violations. Uruguay lacks a comprehensive national child labor policy, and programs to prevent and eliminate child labor are limited.",

The Government continued implementing the National Minimum Standards in Education, a key component of which is child protection.

The law does not establish a minimum age for hazardous work and the law does not prohibit hazardous occupations and activities for children. A mechanism to coordinate government efforts to combat child labor has not been established. Vanuatu does not have any social programs to address child labor, including its worst forms.",

However, children in Zambia continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and mining. Gaps remain in the current legal framework related to children; for instance, the Education Act does not include the specific age at which education is compulsory and the Government has not defined what the school-going age is as required in the law, which may leave children under the legal working age vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.",

The Government of Zimbabwe passed the Trafficking in Persons Act that criminalizes trafficking offenses related to child labor and child pornography. However, children in Zimbabwe continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and mining. Zimbabwe continues to lack specific social programs targeting sectors in which child labor is most prevalent. Gaps remain in the country’s legal framework against child labor, such as the lack of prohibitions of hazardous activities for children, and education is not compulsory or free, which increases children’s vulnerability.",
