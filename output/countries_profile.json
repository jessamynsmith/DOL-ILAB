[{"country": "Afghanistan", "advancement_level": "Moderate Advancement", "description": "In 2013, Afghanistan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Afghanistan announced the adoption of a list of 29 jobs/working conditions prohibited for children. The National Directorate of Security\u2019s (NDS) anti-trafficking in persons/smuggling unit hired 37 new personnel for provincial offices, almost doubling the personnel already in place. The Government\u2019s Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Defense issued directives to prevent the recruitment and sexual abuse of children by the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and began installing the Afghan Human Resources Information Management System (AHRIMS), which will include information on the age of every member of the ANSF. The Government also began participating in a project to combat child labor in the carpet sector. However, children in Afghanistan continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and the worst forms of child labor in the forced production of bricks. Children also continued to be recruited and used for military purposes by non-state groups, as well as by state groups including the Afghan National Police (ANP) and the Afghan Local Police (ALP). The Government does not have a coordinating mechanism to address child labor, sufficient inspectors to enforce child labor laws, or programs to eliminate child labor in sectors where it is prevalent.", "sources": [{"text": "U.S. Department of State. \"Afghanistan,\" in Country Reports on Human Rights Practices- 2013.

{"country": "Benin", "advancement_level": "Moderate Advancement", "description": "In 2013, Benin made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government implemented a nationwide anti-child labor awareness campaign and signed a bi-partite agreement with a Beninese worker association to reduce child labor through increased collaboration. Government officials handled 62 child trafficking cases and 11 exploitive child labor cases, referred 23 suspects to the court system on child labor and trafficking charges, and provided shelter to 173 victims of trafficking. However, children in Benin continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, and in the worst forms of child labor in domestic service. Enforcement efforts in Benin are inadequately funded and staffed, and sentences for those who subject children to the worst forms of child labor were reduced to misdemeanors. Furthermore, Benin\u2019s national action plan pertaining to the worst forms of child labor remains unfunded and its national action plan pertaining to child protections has not been fully funded.", "sources": [{"text": "USDOS official.

The Government established new guidelines to prioritize child labor in the labor inspectorate system and created a national training academy for labor inspectors. The Government also conducted 8,277 child labor inspections and rescued 7,413 children from child labor. It restructured the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor to improve coordination and provide additional resources to local governments, and established a new national plan to combat sexual violence and commercial sexual exploitation of children. However, children in Brazil continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic service. Some local governments lack adequate resources to fully implement national programs to combat child labor, including child trafficking.", "sources": [{"text": "\"Brasil Ainda Tem 1 Milh\u00e3o de Crian\u00e7as que Trabalham.\" Folha de S.

The Government also established Child Protection Units in military zones and provided child protection training.

However, children in Chad continue to engage in child labor, including in cattle herding and in agriculture. Many gaps remain in the legal framework, which leave children vulnerable to exploitation.

{"country": "Costa Rica", "advancement_level": "Significant Advancement", "description": "In 2013, Costa Rica made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. During the reporting period, Costa Rica passed a new anti-trafficking law and strengthened its laws against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The Government also ratified the ILO Convention on Domestic Workers. The labor inspectorate identified 47 child labor cases, and the judicial system prosecuted 20 child labor cases and convicted several offenders. In addition, the Government\u2019s child labor coordinating body provided services to more than 600 former child laborers, and various agencies continued to invest in social protection programs designed to reduce child labor. Despite these efforts, children in Costa Rica continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Social programs do not reach all child laborers, and the numbers of labor inspectors and criminal prosecutors remain inadequate.", "sources": [{"text": "ILO-IPEC.

The Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding on trafficking in persons with the Government of Senegal during the year. In addition, the Government increased funding for a drop-in center that provides medical care, food, and counseling to street children and continued to operate a conditional cash transfer program that provides services to more than 1,000 children rescued from forced begging. However, children in The Gambia continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in domestic service and commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps in the legal framework persist, such as between compulsory education and minimum working ages.

{"country": "Guatemala", "advancement_level": "Moderate Advancement", "description": "In 2013, Guatemala made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government approved an action plan that outlines specific steps for Government agencies to take from 2013 to 2015 to meet the goals set out in its flagship child labor policy, the Roadmap toward the Elimination of Child Labor in Guatemala. The Government also increased its efforts to enforce child labor law by carrying out significantly more inspections than the previous year, allocating additional resources to labor enforcement, and rescuing 159 child victims of human trafficking. In addition, inter-agency committees at the departmental level took actions to combat child labor, such as withdrawing children from work in garbage dumps. However, children in Guatemala continue to engage in child labor, primarily in agriculture. Lack of Government resources, lack of Labor Ministry authority to impose fines, and inadequate judicial enforcement of court orders remain key challenges for enforcement efforts regarding the worst forms of child labor. None of the 346 child labor cases referred to the labor courts in 2013 resulted in an employer sanction. Guatemala also lacks Government programs targeting sectors in which children are known to engage in exploitative labor, such as domestic service, mining, quarrying, and construction.", "sources": [{"text": "Government of Guatemala.

During the project period, school attendance and student performance increased, and the Government aims to mainstream the programs initiated under the project. In August, the Government ratified ILO Convention 189 Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers. However, children in Guyana continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Guyana\u2019s legislation does not fully protect children from the worst forms of child labor. Children 17 years of age are legally permitted to engage in some hazardous activities.

The Government continued to expand access to education and support livelihoods through social programs that provide cash transfers to defray tuition and the cost of school meals during the 2013 school year. However, children in Haiti continue to engage in child labor, including in domestic service and agriculture. Haiti lacks adequate legislation to address the worst forms of child labor, such as trafficking, and a clear, easily applicable minimum age for domestic service, and it has not yet approved a list of hazardous occupations prohibited to children.

Jamaica also continued to participate in the Child Labor Measurement and Policy Development (MAP) program and the Tackling Child Labor through Education (TACKLE) program, through which they published a Child Labor Handbook for Professionals. However, children in Jamaica are engaged in child labor in street work and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. There is no law prohibiting the procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, including drug trafficking and production. The country lacks current nationwide comprehensive statistics on child labor, and it has not enacted a draft Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act.", "sources": [{"text": "International Trade Union Confederation.

The Government also initiated an education program for Syrian refugee children and continued to provide funding for the country\u2019s poverty alleviation program, which included paying school registration fees on behalf of 19,000 children from households living in extreme poverty. However, children in Lebanon continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Labor law enforcement is weakened due to a lack of resources. In addition, enforcement agencies do not maintain enforcement data. Furthermore, gaps in Lebanese law prevent officials from entering private homes, making children who work in these settings unprotected and vulnerable to child labor.", "sources": [{"text": "Child Rights Information Network.

The Government expanded its Program Love to include children from birth to age 6 and, with support from the World Food Program, initiated a national school meal program that targeted 1 million children. The Government also closed La Chureca garbage dump in Managua and created jobs, housing, and a school for the more than 250 families that depended on it for their subsistence. With funding from UNICEF, immigration officials received training on how to identify victims of child trafficking, and social service officials received training on victim care. The Government also ratified the ILO Convention on Domestic Workers. Despite these efforts, children in Nicaragua continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government\u2019s enforcement of labor laws is inadequate, and plans to combat child labor and protect children have not been fully implemented. In addition, Government programs are insufficient to reach the numbers of children engaged in the worst forms of child labor.", "sources": [{"text": "Save the Children.

In May 2013, the Government of Paraguay became the second Latin American country to ratify ILO Convention 189 Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers. The Government conducted human trafficking trainings for law enforcement professionals throughout the country; prosecuted and convicted criminals who violated laws regarding the worst forms of child labor; and expanded health and education services of the Government-funded Embrace Program (Programa Abrazo) in areas of the country with high prevalence of child labor and the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Paraguay continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in domestic service. Paraguay\u2019s system of child labor eradication lacks a formal coordinating mechanism between agencies and remains underfunded relative to the scope of the problem.

The Government also participates in and implements several programs to combat the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Rwanda continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in domestic service. In 2013, children were recruited, some of them forcibly, by the March 23 Movement (M23) for armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. M23 was an armed group based in the Democratic Republic of Congo that the Government of Rwanda supported, but that was disbanded in November 2013.

However, children in Serbia, particularly Roma children, continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the National Assembly did not adopt the 2013\u20132018 national strategy to guide the government\u2019s work in preventing and protecting children from child pornography and trafficking. Serbia\u2019s laws also fail to protect children fully from the worst forms of child labor.

In addition, the Government does not have a list of hazardous occupations prohibited for children, and there is a general lack of coordination among government agencies to address the worst forms of child labor.", "sources": [{"text": "U.S. Department of State. \"Serbia,\" in Trafficking in Persons Report- 2013.

The Government amended the Basic Conditions of Employment Act to include protections for children working without a contract; approved the third phase of the National Child Labor Action Program; and established guidelines for acceptable household chores. In addition, the Government approved the 2013 Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act, which is a comprehensive national anti-trafficking law that includes specific provisions for child trafficking; but the Act has yet to be promulgated and take effect. The Government also trained labor inspectors on child labor issues and maintained programs that assist vulnerable children, including no-fee schools and school feeding programs. Studies also indicate that the Government\u2019s Child Support Grant and the Old Age Pension may help reduce child labor. However, children in South Africa continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic service. In addition, Government social programs to address child labor do not match the scope of the problem. Some families are required to pay local school fees, and all families must pay for books, uniforms, and other school-related expenses, which may affect children\u2019s access to education.

In addition, it adopted a National Youth Policy that seeks to incorporate youth as partners in national development and mainstream youth issues in national policies.

However, children in Turkey continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, mostly in mobile seasonal work.

The survey is the first comprehensive national survey on child labor in Uganda and includes detailed information on the activities of children in the country. The Government also trained 100 immigration officials to identify trafficking victims, registered 399 child victims of trafficking, and rescued 26 children who were being trained in Uganda to assist armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In addition, Uganda began to participate in two new child labor projects. However, children from Uganda are reportedly recruited and forcibly abducted to join rebel militias operating in the DRC and Kenya. Within the country, children continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in agriculture and in commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps in the legal framework persist, such as between compulsory education and minimum working ages, and enforcement information is not made available.", "sources": [{"text": "Uganda Bureau of Statistics.

{"country": "Ukraine", "advancement_level": "Moderate Advancement", "description": "In 2013, Ukraine made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government increased the punishment for engaging children in pornography, begging, and other exploitative labor to between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment. It provided training on child labor to labor inspectors and on trafficking to law enforcement and migration officials as well as judges. It provided the Cyber Crimes Department with new software to track child pornography. The Ministry of Social Protection (MSP) also published standardized guidelines for all regions to use in providing services to trafficking victims. However, children continue to engage in child labor in the service sector and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, including pornography. Gaps remain in some areas of laws as well as policy and program implementation. The Criminal Code does not prohibit the possession of child pornography and lacks clarity regarding the age of consent for sexual relationships. The National Action Plan to Implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the National Program for Combating Human Trafficking remained unfunded in 2013.

Although the Government continues to publicly deny the use of forced labor, including of children, in the cotton harvest, information indicates that children continue to be required to engage in the worst forms of child labor in cotton production. The Government invited an ILO high level-mission to observe the fall 2013 harvest, and reports indicate that the Government did ensure that young children (under age 15) were able to continue to attend school during the harvest season. However, local government officials continued to close secondary schools (colleges and lyceums) during the harvest, mobilizing children ages 15 to 17 to pick cotton to meet the Government-mandated harvest quotas.", "sources": [{"text": "ILO Committee of Experts.

{"country": "Yemen", "advancement_level": "Minimal Advancement", "description": "In 2013, Yemen made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In March, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor (MOSAL) issued Ministerial Decree Number 11, which codifies the age limit for hazardous work, and lists specific jobs considered hazardous for children and penalties for employers who violate the law. The Ministry of Education, MOSAL, and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) are participating in donor-funded programs that target special needs groups, including child laborers and street children, and in rehabilitation of schools affected by violence due the country\u2019s internal conflicts. However, children in Yemen continue to engage in child labor in the agriculture sector and in the worst forms of child labor as child soldiers. Gaps in laws, enforcement, policies, and programs to combat child labor remain. There is no information available on whether enforcement actions were taken during the reporting period, and the child labor policy has not been implemented for more than five years. Both the Yemeni Army and other armed groups continue to use children in the country\u2019s internal conflicts. No evidence was found of Government efforts to provide demobilization and rehabilitation services to child soldiers who have been involved in combat.", "sources": [{"text": "Integrated Regional Information Networks. \"Yemen: Child Soliders Used by Both Sides in Northern Conflict.\" IRINnews.org [online] December 10, 2009 [cited February 5, 2014]; www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=21420&flag=news.", "number": "1"}, {"text": "United Press International Inc. \"HRW: Child Soliders in Yemen.\" upi.com [online] April 15, 2011 [cited March 8, 2014]; http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2011/04/15/HRW-Child-soldiers-in-Yemen/UPI-47071302890484/.", "number": "2"}, {"text": "Alaug, AK.
