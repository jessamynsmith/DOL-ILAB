However, children in Afghanistan continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and the worst forms of child labor in the forced production of bricks. Children also continued to be recruited and used for military purposes by non-state groups, as well as by state groups including the Afghan National Police (ANP) and the Afghan Local Police (ALP).

Despite political unrest during the year and the Government entering caretaker status in November 2013, the Government took several actions to address child labor. In collaboration with the private sector, the Government focused on prevention efforts to combat labor abuses, including child labor, in the fishing sector. Fishing coordination centers were created in seven provinces to increase protection for workers, including strengthening monitoring through inspections and registering of workers. In addition, the Government enacted the Transnational Organized Crime Act and ratified the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol in order to strengthen institutional frameworks on transnational organized crimes that can include the worst forms of child labor and human trafficking. The Government improved its data collection systems for reporting on identification and investigations of trafficking cases, and reported on the number of child victims involved in these cases. However, children in Thailand continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the shrimp and seafood processing sector, and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Thailand remains weak in its enforcement efforts, particularly in the home-based business sectors.
